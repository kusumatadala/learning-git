# learning-git
## using this repository I am learning how to use git& github

### let me give you the steps that I have followed

- [x] First of all, downloaded git as mentioned [here](https://nerdschalk.com/how-to-install-and-use-git-on-windows-11/)  
- [x] Later created a new repository on github named *learning-git*  
- [x] and got the https address of the repository by clicking on *code* button 
- [x] opened **git bash**   
- [x] typed the command  ```git clone https://github.com/kusumatadala/learning-git.git```  
- [x] Then a duplicate of the remote repository was created locally with the name *learning-git*  
- [x] did the neccesary changes i.e created a *demo.txt* file using vs code  
- [x] Again, opened the git bash and typed ```cd learning-git```  
- [x] Then,```git status```, this command showed the changes   
- [x] added the demo.txt file to the staging area using ```git add demo.txt```  
- [x] next cmmited the file with the command ```git commit -m "added the demo text file"```   
- [x] finally pushed the demo.txt using the command ```git remote origin main```   
\*\*In order to use the above command ,we need to know the name of remote,most of the time it is origin,otherwise you can get it using the command ```git remote``` \*\*  
\*\* I did learn the markdown syntax to write this file from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/project/wiki/markdown-guidance?view=azure-devops) \*\*
